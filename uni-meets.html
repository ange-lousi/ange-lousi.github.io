                    <h2> University students struggle to make friendships.</h2>

                    <p class="p-section">Humans are inherently social creatures. We crave a form of belonging and a
                        sense of connectedness
                        that has been hard-wired into our behavior for survival since the beginning of human evolution.
                        So as a university student, the rigor of college and its ever-changing schedules make it
                        difficult to connect with other students, especially those who want to communicate with others
                        but struggle to make that first step due to personal barriers. As a senior, I noticed how many
                        of my peers, especially the juniors, found it difficult to find this sense of belonging and
                        connectedness, sparking the question-why was there such disconnect in our lives? And how might
                        we help university students make friends faster?

                    <h2>UniMeets: an events-based networking app that connects students through shared interests.</h2>
                    <p class="p-section">The goal of my project was to provide a headstart for students who have a hard
                        time forming friendships, whether it be due to their fast-changing schedules or their struggle
                        with social interaction; I wanted to create a safe platform for students who wish to make
                        genuine friends. So I tried to rethink how students could engage in more fun, meaningful, and
                        productive ways to build those friendships and form sincere connections.</p>
                    <p class="p-section">UniMeets is an events-based networking app that allows users to create profiles
                        and add interests
                        that generate events based on the user's interests. Users need to mark an event they want to
                        attend where they will be grouped with other students who will also be in attendance. From
                        there, they will automatically be added to a group chat where they can introduce themselves and
                        get to know one another, to eventually attend the event and meet peers from their school.</p>

                    <p class="p-section">I began doing some research to see what's currently out there. I noted down the
                        four most popular
                        platforms, identified vital features I envisioned UniMeets to have, and reassessed existing
                        platforms based on those features. To my surprise, various friend apps also included an
                        event-based element. However, no specific event app caters explicitly to university students.
                        Although there are also social media platforms such as Instagram and Facebook, those sites are
                        more for maintaining friendships than creating new ones. </p>

                    <h2>Setbacks + a new direction for new friendships.
                    </h2>
                    <p class="p-section">At first, I spent the first 2 - 3 weeks brainstorming, wireframing, and
                        designing a social networking app solely catered towards uni students. But I kept hesitating on
                        the idea because I thought, if I did that, how would it be any different from any other social
                        networking apps out there? Then I figured, maybe Augmented Reality? But then, not everyone will
                        have access to the equipment, which would become more of a hassle than a benefit. Plus, the same
                        effects that you could have using AR could be used through a simple smartphone app. So I decided
                        to
                        beef up the social networking approach instead by catering to events and
                        using a topic that will make people come together based on what they are interested in, which
                        would be a great icebreaker when making friends. Hence why I stuck with an app for my final
                        solution.</p>

                    <p class="p-section">To better understand this project's scope, I identified three key features
                        using the main pain
                        points of the user story. I found that planning out the task flow early on helped me make better
                        design decisions as I could identify areas of opportunities. The key tasks users needed to be
                        able to accomplish were:</p>

                    <p class="p-section">
                        This was my first-ever solo UX project ðŸ¥³. More than the actual output, I'm grateful to
                        have
                        been
                        through an entire UX process, so I can see what it's actually like. Here are a few things
                        I've
                        learned:
                    </p>

                    <ul>
                        <li><strong style="font-size: 18px; font-style: Montserrat;">Iterate as much as you
                                can.</strong> I explored many different options in the beginning stages to find the
                            right solution for my users. I ended up "restarting" my project three times via
                            brainstorming and wireframing to ensure that every aspect of the app was made with
                            intention.
                        </li>
                        <li>
                            <strong style="font-size: 18px; font-style: Montserrat;">Be decisive.</strong>
                            After I decided on the direction of this app and began the research process, it became very
                            tempting to get sidetracked by adding more features to the design. Sometimes a new idea
                            would come to mind, and I would be tempted to revise the entire plan because I thought of a
                            completely different approach. Hence, in the future, I believe concentrating on an idea or
                            theory that solves the pain points before branching off towards other features, reducing the
                            completion time of the case study.
                        </li>
                        <li>
                            <strong style="font-size: 18px; font-style: Montserrat;">The only real mistake is the
                                one
                                from which we learn nothing.</strong> From catching errors in my UI to uncovering more
                            foundational UX problems in my app, I am thankful for the Human-Computer Interaction course
                            I did at uni and the various online resources which I could fall back on when I needed
                            guidance. Though there is much more room for improvement, I have constructed the app as best
                            I could and did not let my thoughts and opinions stop me from questioning if my own
                            decisions were truly best for the user.
                        </li>
